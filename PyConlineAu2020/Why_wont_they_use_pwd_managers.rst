Why won't they just use a password manager already!?

Hi! I'm Keira and today I want to tell you why people don't use password
managers.


<numbers>
---------
How many people use a password manager?

Depending on the study, around 12% use a third party manager, and 18% use
the browser's inbuilt password manager.

Why does it matter?
-------------------
Credential leaks cause huge financial losses and personal heartache.

Passwords are fundamentally anti-human infrastructure. We are bad at memorising,
we are very bad at randomising, and we have changes in need and ability. Somewhere
between 80 and 87% of people admit to reusing passwords, and around 2% use the
same password for EVERY service.

Until we all upload our minds directly into the Internet, password managers are
a good way to prevent reuse and other password problems.


<Myths>
-------
I gave a much longer version of this talk last year, and everyone I mentioned
it to assumed they knew why people don't use password managers. And mostly the
assumptions have been wrong.

Here's the two biggest myths.

1. Laziness
It's not because people lazy. We like to think people are lazy because we'd
mostly prefer to play mario kart than do the dishes. But people just aren't
really that lazy when they're motivated. Right this second, there are people
knitting, volunteering at conferences, and watching tech talks,
or perhaps all three at once, on THEIR SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
Clearly we can do things when we are sufficiently motivated to.

2. Feeling secure
It's also not because people feel secure enough online.

In my survey results, 92% of people were worried about their credentials being
leaked. Pew research found 93% of people were concerned about who could access
their data.


So, why don't people use password managers?
-------------------------------------------
People don't use password managers because they are people.

But here are the top 5 reasons broken down:

5. We don't like to use things we're not sure we can use well
People are concerned they won't be able to use the software, or will do something
wrong and lose all their passwords forever.

4. If something doesn't match our core values, we discount it
People report that using a password manager makes them feel out of control.
Control and independence are common core values among adults. So they reject
password managers.

3. We are bad at threat perception when the threat is not a tiger chasing us
Not-tech people think hacking is targeted at an individual. They know they aren't
that important so they downplay that threat.

2. We get confused and do nothing if the experts don't all agree
To be bothered to make a change in behaviour, we need to be presented with a
solution that will fix our problem. And tech as a community hasn't been great at
giving people clear, kind, and consistent advice on password managers. (If you
don't believe me, look up 'are password managers safe')

1. Security!
The number one reason given by those who reject password managers, is that they
don't trust the software. And I get it. "Install this free software and give it
all your passwords" absolutely sounds like a scam.


Summary
-------
When we offer a tool that people aren't sure they can use, makes them feel they've
lost control, fixes a problem they're not convinced they have, that experts can't
agree is necessary, and looks like a scam... can we blame them for rejecting it?


Oh no, what do we do!?
----------------------
1. If you design, design to reduce user effort and increase user comfort

2. Be clear on the effectiveness of your solution

3. Be a cheerleader, not a fearmonger



Conclusion
----------
Humans are complex, and varied creatures, but we do share a lot of our basic
motivations. We seek connection, acceptance and validation, and we try to avoid
embarrassment, rejection and danger.

If you want to change behaviour, and help your friends be safe online, tailor
your help by remembering they we're all human.
