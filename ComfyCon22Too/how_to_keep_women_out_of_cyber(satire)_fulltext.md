## BEFORE WE BEGIN
Hi, I’m Keira. I’m a web developer, I work in two tiny teams so I’m also security. One of the hoards of people who accidentally have this responsibility.

I wanted to say a couple of things before I slip into the satire.

First, this *is* satire. I don't want anyone to think for a second that I or the organisers of ComfyCon want to prevent women joining cyber security. This talk is a way to have a laugh while engaging with some deeper material, and hopefully leaving you with some ideas of how NOT to be the problem.

Second, where examples are given they are real and have happened to me or people I trust, within the last 8 years. This isn't ancient history.

Not all women will have the same concerns. It might not reflect the experience of non binary people, black and indigenous women, or women with disabilities. You can assume that these examples are definitely NOT the worst things anyone has experienced. But the things I’ll mention are known to generally make women uncomfortable or unwelcome.

Last, I know this isn't a problem caused by all men, or exclusively caused by men. If the shoe doesn't fit, don't wear it.

With that done, so begins the satire!

## INTRO
So here we are. 2022, and women have been joining cyber at an alarming rate.   In the US women’s participation rose from 11% to 24% over just a few years. In Australia women now make up 16% of the industry. I don’t have numbers for non-binary people, but I am sure they are concerning.

Gone are the days when we could just assume that women would be weeded out of maths and science in their teens, or get pregnant early enough and often enough that they were too busy to pursue their non-family interests. Even the law is no longer on our side.

But thanks to some lingering structural inequalities, a slow-changing media culture, and the realities of child rearing under capitalism, we've got a fighting chance.

Some of us in the industry have been working hard to keep women from settling in.

Of course, of course, #NotAllMen.

And I ask you, why not?!

There are plenty of things we can all do to contribute to the discomfort and exclusion of women and non-binary people, whether you're a colleague, manager, conference organiser, founder, tutor or colourful community identity.


## TRAINING and MEETUPS
Obviously the best bet is to prevent people getting in the door in the first place. So how can we keep our places of learning just for the boys?

Ask women, or anyone not wearing the uniform hoody, if they are lost.

Make sure teachers say things like “you don’t look like a nerd”, or “I’m surprised you want to hang out with the geeks” when girls show interest in STEM subjects. If mature women join a course, make sure they know how out-of-place they are.

Don’t ask pronouns, don’t give yours.

Make sure the toilet situation is binary, causing discomfort and risk for many non-binary or trans people. And only have two gender fields on any given form.

Make sure group discussions are combative. Make people compete, and belittle those who don't know something. This is likely to keep out all sorts of undesirables, as well as women.

If a woman gets the wrong answer, assume it is because she is a woman, not an individual.

In formal training, mark down for a lack of public contribution, ignoring the reasons why minorities, who are aware they're judged differently, might not speak up.

Ignore harassment. She needs to know what it will be like in the industry.


## RECRUITMENT
Recruit primarily at meetups or via introductions from your guys. This keeps 'outsiders' out, and holds mothers back in particular, as many can't regularly attend weeknight events.

If you're recruiting at DEFCON or the like, have your company's recruitment party at a strip club. This will put lots of women (and others) off attending.

Never have any part time or job share roles. If you are open to part time, don't mention it in the ad.

If you feel you must have part time options, make sure they are tokenistic, like a 9 day fortnight, to make it clear they are meant to be for the benefit of men with hobbies, not people with significant caring responsibilities.

Insist the role requires extensive travel, weekend hours and unplanned overtime.

Never hire enough people to comfortably cover your service window, just insist your staff sacrifice their home lives instead.

These have the added bonus of helping to prevent any men who are sympathetic to gender equality from taking on an equal role at home too, making life difficult for their partners and setting a poor example for their children. Propping up the patriarchy on all fronts, good job!

Use phrases in your ads that convey domination, individualism, and exceptionalism like "rock star", "hero", "10x", "alpha". List every criteria you can imagine, not just your must-haves.

In the interview, ask women if they are comfortable working in an all male team. Make sure they know they may need a tough skin. Say this as though you are helping.

Never train your recruitment staff in unconscious bias, or take steps to prevent such bias from entering your hiring decisions.

Whatever your company approach to neurodiversity in the workplace, make absolutely sure you don't consider how it may show up in women differently to men. Expect women staff to meet aesthetic, deportment and interaction standards you'd never require of male staff.

Never advertise the pay. Ask interviewees what they'd expect to be paid. If a woman's answer seems to low to you, take it as a win. Just ignore the literal centuries of history which affect how men and women assess their value and assume that's all she's worth. For bonus points, tell her she can't discuss her pay with her colleagues.

Ask women if they have children, if they plan to, and if they plan to have more. 80% of women will have children, but 20 won’t, so make sure to judge them as a poor fit either way. Never ask men the same thing.

Hire mainly on culture fit. Where by culture fit, you mean same gender, same colour, same vibe, willing to work very long hours.

Never hire someone who has had "dramas" at a previous workplace, even if the drama was them being the victim of bullying, harassment or abuse.


## IN THE WORKPLACE
It’s not good enough to look only at the pipeline though. 38% of women are reportedly planning to leave tech within the next two years. That’s a good start, but what can we do to speed up the exodus?

Only put one women in each team, max. Never let women support each other in mostly-male teams by working together and developing solidarity.

If you give a woman a challenging project, make sure it's under-resourced and likely to fail. The rest of the time, give her boring work below her capacity, that no one else wants.

Don't let her attend client meetings or present her own work. Where possible, take credit for her work and ideas.

If you need to find someone, and you only know the role, be dubious or surprised or outright disbelieving if the person in a role is a woman.

Don’t have sanitary bins in all toilet stalls. This is an issue for anyone with a shedding uterus or bladder problems, so you can cause problems for omen, non-binary people, trans men and disabled people with just one thoughtless gesture.

You can make mothers and non-binary parents unwelcome by making leave difficult to access, ensure there are no private spaces for breast-milk pumping, and talk about the importance of doing industry or learning activities in their "spare time".

Suggest to women that it's a "Career limiting move" to have children.

While we're talking about icky body things, it's a good idea to make sure your managers don't know anything about, and aren't safe people to talk to about, fertility treatments, pregnancy, menstruation, menopause or transition. These things can all require leave or adjustment at work, and you can make people's work lives extremely uncomfortable by refusing to acknowledge this.

Champion "facts over feelings". Do not consider that women are usually not in quantitative studies and therefore there are often no "objective" figures to back up what women are experiencing. Tell her concerns aren't relevant to "normal" or “most” people.

Talk about emotions vs rationality, but be careful to only consider crying or women's reactions "emotional". Men's rage, frustration or anger are exempt, because they only express such feeling over serious, rational issues, like who should be allowed to play the character Doctor Who.

Men, famously, have neither bodies nor emotions - much better workers!

Give women feedback that they are too aggressive, or too lacking in confidence. Allow no middle ground.

Don’t have any onboarding process for new team members. "It's sink or swim here, bro. This is how the big boys roll!"

As a colleague, make sure women know where they stand by using feminine terms to describe things and people you don't like. Pussy, princess, little girl, and bitch are a good start. This tip will probably also work for ensuring gay men feel unwelcome in your team. Extra points for rape used as an analogy for workplace successes or failures.

Avoid difficult conversations with staff or colleagues about bullying or harassment. To "resolve" bullying complaints, suggest women or non binary staff just avoid that person who is treating them badly.

Celebrate "difficult geniuses" who excel at highly technical work and who don't treat other people well. 

Get women team members to take minutes, get coffee or bring snacks.

Make no one responsible for workplace dishes or cleanliness. Sooner or later a women will "choose" to clean up after everyone.


## IN THE COMMUNITY and CONFERENCES
Maybe you're a conference organiser or community wrangler?

Make sure there very few women speakers in your conference line ups. Or go for gold and try for no women speakers at all!

Make sure that women or non-binary speakers are are scheduled at the same time as a keynote, and/or in the smallest room, and/or early on the morning after the party.

Have booth babes.

Never offer childcare, and don't stream or record your talks.

Keep the focus at 'women in cyber' events on fixing women so they are more like the men. Never hold talks about bias at “mainstream” events attended by men.

Keep inviting and accepting speakers who are known to have harassed, assaulted or stalked people, or who express views of women's general inferiority.

If you have an event security/safety team, fill it with dudes who want to cosplay at being cops.

Never do nameless reviews of talk proposals - you might find you accidentally pick more women.

Never have a code of conduct, or never enforce it. Don't moderate discussion in online spaces.


## AS AN INDIVIDUAL
Even if you have no structural power, we can all play a role.

Assume that a woman at a conference is looking to date, interested in dating you, and would be pleased if you hit on her.

Have you considered simply groping women at networking events?

Assume women have attended events with a male partner. If they say they work in cyber, assume they mean in marketing or design.

Assume general incompetence in women.

Post online about this assumed incompetence.

If a woman encountered someone groping or assault, blame her or tell her she's lying.

Ask women at a conference if they will give you an invitation to the 'secret women's only party'.

Try to lie your way in to the not-actually-secret not-actually-womens-only women in tech/sec party that you weren't invited to.

Never attend talks by or about women. Never read anything about gender, culture, or race, from a writer who has lived experience of these things.

Assume that men who are confident talking about these issues and are smart at other things must know what they're talking about on this issue too.

Assume that because *you* are smart at other things you're opinions on things like gender equality, affirmative action, and merit are also well-informed and sensible.

Refer to hypothetical senior professionals as "grey beards". Refer to hypothetical people who don't know anything about tech as a "grandmas".

Don't follow any women or non binary people on Twitter, LinkedIn, Mastodon etc.

constantly remind women that they are out of place.

Use the language of protest and liberation movements to explain your own lack of desire to change. Pretend "bringing your whole self to work" means never having to keep a racist comment or rape joke to yourself.

Use the term "technical" as though it means"intelligent". Make it clear that "non-technical" roles are less-than.

Talk about the "pipeline problem" and "teaching girls to code" but don't step up for your adult women colleagues. Little girls are a lot more palatable than women - they're not angry yet

Make endless excuses for men who say or do sexist things. "He didn't mean it". Or "he's just a bit socially awkward". Do not make excuses for women, especially transwomen, if they are forceful or prickly in their own defence.


## WHAT IF YOU"RE A WOMAN
Women can contribute in most of the ways I've already suggested, but there are some extra things you can do. Pull that ladder up behind you.

If you haven't encountered anything you recognise as sexism in the workplace, assume that other women are making it up, complaining, or not tough enough, or just need to be more like you.

Never consider how your experience might be different if you were a parent, came in from a different pathway, looked different or had aged a little more.

If possible, proclaim publicly that you'd be embarrassed to receive any benefit as the result of affirmative action measures.

Say things like, "I had to do it, you can too". Definitely don't read anything about survivorship bias.


## CONCLUSION
So that's a long, but not exhaustive, list of how we could keep women out of cyber, and make it an unwelcoming place for people of other genders too.

I've put a list of resources on making workplaces more welcoming up on my github, in case you'd like to add them to your workplace blocklist. (I'll show the link in a minute).


{% endblock satire %}

Back out of the satire now, back to just being me.

I hope no one here does ALL these things, but if you did see yourself, or your corner of the industry in these things, that's OK. This is your invitation to learn and grow.

My twitter and mastodon are both @keira_reckons, but I'm just a whole person there so don't expect too much, it's not a branded work account.

Any questions?
