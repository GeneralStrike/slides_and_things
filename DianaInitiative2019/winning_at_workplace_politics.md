## Description
Chances are, you’re frustrated that your ideas, solutions, and advice just don’t seem to get through to the decision-makers you work with. This happens to everyone from time to time, but if it’s a regular occurrence for you, you might need to learn to increase your influence at work.

Influence is the difference between that person at work whose team always seems to get extra staffing, or that developer who always gets to choose the tech, and those that don’t.

It isn’t magic, it isn’t luck, and it isn’t just natural ability. You can learn how to increase your influence through some simple planning, framing and delivery steps.

These skills are important if you want to make sure your expert opinion is understood and considered by those making crucial decisions about budgets, time frames, architecture, security and even everyday things like the air-conditioning temperature.

In this interactive workshop I will explain the basics of influence in a workplace, talk you through the steps, and walk you through addressing a real problem in your real workplace.
