## Description
Empathy as a security tool has been trending lately, mostly regarding attackers. But what does it look like to be 
empathetic to our users? Toward developers? Toward those who make the bugs, cut the corners, reuse their passwords
and decline 2FA? And where do you even start?

I will make the case that empathetic security design and communication will:

- increase take-up of security behaviors by users and developers
- improve your ability, as a security professional, to communicate security concepts to developers, decision-makers,
  designers and users, and
- help you design better tools and tips for users.

The core of the talk will focus on understanding users and developers. I will give three key concepts to guide you toward
empathy, and I will present some entertaining and enlightening research on the beliefs, feelings and threat models that
inform user behavior, and answer the question “why won’t users just get password managers already?” (It’s probably not what
you think!)

To finish, I will give you some practical techniques for teasing out the reasons behind the reasons why your target audience,
be they users, developers, or others, act the way they do, and tools for turning those reasons into incentives for better
behavior and mutually agreeable outcomes.
