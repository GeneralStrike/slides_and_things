# slides_and_things
## What is this thing?
Slides, notes, and reading lists from talks I've given at tech conferences

## Can I use your slides?
Feel free to use these slides for inspiration, to show your team, or to build
upon for your own talks.

As a general courtesy, please don't pass these slides off as your own.

## I'm available!
If you'd like me to come to your workplace, conference, community event or
thing, let me know. I can adapt or create new material as needed.
